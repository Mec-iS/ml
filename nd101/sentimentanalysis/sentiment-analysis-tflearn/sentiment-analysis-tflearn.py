Lycasin has only a 20-30\% lower glycemic index than sugar , not 0 , like they lead you to believe. But you will not know this as you eat one after another of these tasty little fruity guys ... A few handfuls later ( maybe more ... ) you may notice your tummy rumbling . But these taste so good you may just keep snacking away . Even if you do not  it may be too late .

The Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears can apparently cause diarrhea if you eat more than 15 , for example (YMMV) . They are a godsend for me . They taste great , they are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than all the medications to relieve the constipation I have been given ( both prescription and over the counter ) , and more importantly , they actually work . I am a normal person if I eat 25 of these in a sitting every day . I have told my pain doctors about this and they are now recommending this product to all their patients .
